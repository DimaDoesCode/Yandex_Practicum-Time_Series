The company "NeatTaxi" has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, it's necessary to forecast the number of taxi orders for the next hour. Build a model for such prediction.<br>
The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value on the test set should not exceed 48.
