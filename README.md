The online store "WikiShop" is launching a new service. Now users can edit and enhance product descriptions, similar to wiki communities. In other words, customers suggest their edits and comment on others' changes. The store requires a tool that can identify toxic comments and send them for moderation.<br>

Train a model to classify comments into positive and negative categories. You have a dataset with labels indicating the toxicity of edits. Build a model with an F1 quality metric of no less than 0.75.
